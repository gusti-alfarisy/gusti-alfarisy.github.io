## Research Agendas

![Current research agendas](assets/theme/images/main_illustration_final.png)
> **We have experienced the outstanding performance of artificial intelligence surpassing human capability. Yet, they are unable to acknowledge fully that they do not know and learn the novel phenomenon continuously like humans. In my current research agenda, I am exploring a technique to enhance an agent to identify unknown categories and learn them continuously in domain-specific problem.  This will make the agent become reliable and able to adapt to the open-world environment in the agent interest only. The applications can be applied to ecology, healthcare, smart cities, robotics, chatbot or intelligent systems. We named this as _Domain-Specific Open-World Recognition_.**

We are interested in the domain-specific open-world recognition problems in **Environmental/Biodiversity Monitoring and Conservation**, **Lifelong Chatbot**, **Web Intelligence**,  and **Agriculture/Food**.

## Short Biography

Hi, greetings from Borneo Island! I am an assistant professor at Institut Teknologi Kalimantan at the Department of Informatics. Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. degree in Artificial Intelligence at the School of Digital Science, Universiti Brunei Darussalam under supervision of Dr. Owais Ahmed Malik and Dr. Ong Wee Hong.

I have been teaching several topics including algorithms and programming languages, data structures, functional programming, numerical methods, machine learning, artificial intelligence, deep learning, web intelligence, and software engineering. I have reviewed several articles in Springer and Elsevier Journals. My research interest includes:

- Open-World Lifelong Machine Learning
- Computer Vision
- Web Intelligence
- Natural Language Processing
- LLM
- Ecological and Environmental Informatics

## Main Projects

### Open-World Lifelong Learning for Biodiversity Monitoring

In a world teeming with diverse ecosystems, continuous and adaptive biodiversity monitoring is vital, as biodiversity plays a crucial role in our sustainability as humans. Open-world lifelong learning offers an innovative approach to monitoring that evolves alongside the environment. Unlike traditional models, which require retraining with new data and struggle to identify unknown classes, open-world lifelong learning systems autonomously learn and adapt over time, recognizing and integrating new species and ecological changes without restarting from scratch. The primary challenge lies in mitigating catastrophic interference to achieve true open-world capability.

### Lifelong Learning Chatbot for Academic Services and SMEs

This project aims to develop a chatbot that continuously learns and evolves to support both academic and business contexts. In its initial stage, the chatbot will focus on providing accurate and reliable academic information within a university setting, such as course schedule and policy updates. Over time, it is envisioned to go beyond simple question answering by integrating with institutional APIs, enabling users to perform tasks such as course registration, document submission, and other administrative processes directly through natural conversation. In parallel, the chatbot will be extended to serve small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This lifelong learning approach ensures that the chatbot remains up-to-date, context-aware, and adaptable to evolving academic and business needs.

### Biodiversity and Forestry Portal in Borneo

This project is carried out to create a comprehensive digital platform that integrates data, tools, and services to support biodiversity conservation and sustainable forestry management in the island of Borneo. The portal will serve as a centralized hub for researchers, policymakers, and local communities by providing access to species distribution data, forest cover maps, and real-time monitoring of deforestation or biodiversity. It will also enable the integration of AI-powered features, such as automated species identification and predictive models for forest health assessment. In the long term, the portal is envisioned as an open-access platform that facilitates collaboration, promotes public awareness, and contributes to balancing ecological conservation with economic development in the region.
