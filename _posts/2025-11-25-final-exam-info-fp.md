## Preparation – Week 15

Before the final examination, **each group is required to obtain feedback from the lecturer during Week 15**. To accomplish this, you must **print your source code** and **submit the corresponding Markdown file** through the provided link.

### Requirements
- The printed source code **must include line numbers** and be printed on a **white background** for readability.
- Submit the **Markdown file** online as instructed. **Google Drive**: [Submission Class A](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sRTKtqmRNLWPUhZKBmBwKBE8H7msdpiJ?usp=sharing) | [Submission Class B](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1r9Y0noO48L5FsuwzHAxHv5NHUmTAKGyc?usp=sharing)
- Place the printed version **on my desk**.
- You may generate a PDF version from your Markdown file for printing.

### Submission Deadlines
- **Class A:** 28 November 2025  
- **Class B:** 1 December 2025  

> **Note:** The feedback stage contributes **20% of your final exam score**. The score will be assigned in Week 16 based on the quality of your revisions after receiving feedback.

### If You Have a Schedule Conflict
If you have a serious scheduling conflict, **you must inform the lecturer *before* the presentation day** so an alternative can be arranged.  
Late communication cannot be accommodated.

## Markdown Format

```markdown
# Title of the Project
_A Functional Programming Approach with Rust_  
**Authors:** Name 1, Name 2, Name 3

---

## Abstract
Provide a concise summary of the project, its goals, the technologies used (Rust + Axum/Rocket/GTK4+/Tauri), and how functional programming principles were applied.

---

## Introduction
Explain the motivation behind the project:

- What problem does your application solve?
- Why did you choose Rust?
- Why integrate functional programming concepts?
- What makes your solution unique or interesting?

---

## Background and Concepts
Introduce key concepts relevant to the project:

### Technology Stack
- Rust  
- Framework (Axum, Rocket, GTK4+, Tauri, or CLI)  
- Async runtime (Tokio, if used)  
- Supporting crates (serde, anyhow, thiserror, etc.)

Each concept should give readers enough context to understand your design.
