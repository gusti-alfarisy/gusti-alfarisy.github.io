## Search

![simplified road map of part of Romania](/assets/theme/images/posts/map_romania.png)

Can we solve the route problem from city A to city B using simple search like BFS?

A node in a tree typically have:
- STATE
- PARENT
- CHILDREN

### Best-First Search

A node in Best-First Search typically have:
- STATE: the state in current node
- PARENT: the path or reference to the parent node consisting similar properties
- ACTION: the action of node that carried out
- PATH-COST: total cost from inital node until current node

Frontier is a queue that consist of:
- IS-EMPTY(frontier)
- POP(frontier)
- TOP(frontier)
- ADD(node, frontier)

The algorithm:

```
function BEST-FIRST-SEARCH(problem, f) returns a solution node or failure

    node ‚Üê NODE(S TATE=problem.INITIAL)
    frontier ‚Üê a priority queue ordered by f , with node as an element
    reached ‚Üê a lookup table, with one entry with key problem.INITIAL and value node
    while not IS-EMPTY(frontier) do
        node ‚Üê POP(frontier)
        if problem.IS-GOAL(node.STATE) then return node
        for each child in EXPAND(problem, node) do
            s ‚Üê child.STATE
        if s is not in reached or child.PATH-COST < reached[s].PATH-COST then
            reached[s] ‚Üê child
            add child to frontier
    return failure

function EXPAND( problem, node) yields nodes
    s ‚Üê node.S TATE
    for each action in problem.ACTIONS(s) do
        s' ‚Üê problem.RESULT(s, action)
        cost ‚Üê node.PATH-COST + problem.ACTION-COST(s, action, s0)
        yield NODE(STATE=s' , PARENT=node, ACTION=action, PATH-COST=cost)
```

## Measuring Problem-Solving Performance

- *Completeness*: This measurement ensure that the algorithm will return a solution or return "not found" if it does not have a solution.
- *Cost Optimality*: This will measure the cost or path to the solution. Ideally, low cost is preferrable
- *Time Complexity*: This will measure the duration or time for finding the solution.
- *Space Complexity*: This measure the space or memory to find the desired solution.


## Informed (Heuristic) Search

The heuristic function is an estimated cost/fitness to the solution. For shortest distance, it can be the stright line.

Example of heuristic function for the shortest distance:

- Greedy best-first search

![Greedy Best-First Search illustration](/assets/theme/images/posts/greedy_example.png)

- A* search

$$
f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
$$

$$g(n)$$ is the actual cost and $$h(n)$$ is the heuristic/estimated function

## Local Search and Optimization Problem

![state space landscape](/assets/theme/images/posts/ss_landscape.png)


### Hill-Climbing Search

```
function HILL-CLIMBING(problem) returns a state that is a local maximum
    current ‚Üê problem.INITIAL
    while true do
        neighbor ‚Üê a highest-valued successor state of current
        if VALUE(neighbor) ‚â§ VALUE(current) then return current
        current ‚Üê neighbor
```

Please define the objective function..!?


## Global Search

### Simulated Annealing: Single-Based Solution


```
function SIMULATED-ANNEALING(problem, schedule) returns a solution state
    current ‚Üê problem.INITIAL
    for t = 1 to ‚àû do
        T ‚Üê schedule(t)
        if T = 0 then return current
        next ‚Üê a randomly selected successor of current
        ‚àÜE ‚Üê VALUE(current) ‚Äì VALUE(next)
        if ‚àÜE > 0 then current ‚Üê next
        else current ‚Üê next only with probability e^{‚àÜE/T}
```
### Genetic Algorithm: Population-Based Solution

![8queen genetic algorithm](/assets/theme/images/posts/8queen_ga.png)

```
function GENETIC-ALGORITHM(population, fitness) returns an individual
    repeat
        weights ‚Üê WEIGHTED-BY(population, fitness)
        population2 ‚Üê empty list
        for i = 1 to SIZE(population) do
        parent1, parent2 ‚Üê WEIGHTED-RANDOM-CHOICES(population, weights, 2)
        child ‚Üê REPRODUCE(parent1, parent2)
        if (small random probability) then child ‚Üê MUTATE(child)
        add child to population2
        population ‚Üê population2
    until some individual is fit enough, or enough time has elapsed
    return the best individual in population, according to fitness

function REPRODUCE(parent1, parent2) returns an individual
    n ‚Üê LENGTH(parent1)
    c ‚Üê random number from 1 to n
    return APPEND(SUBSTRING(parent1, 1, c), SUBSTRING(parent2, c + 1, n))
```
## Exercise

Please submit the assingment before **7 October 2025** (Week 5).

Please implement the genetic algorithm to find the optimal course schedule in informatics! The students need to specify the solution representation, the objective function, reproduction/recombination mechanism, and mutation mechanism. Please run for several generation (let say 30-100).

The chapter should includes:
- **Solution Representation, Objective, and Genetic Operators** (how solution is being presented? how the objective/fitness function is defined? how genetic operator behave on your solution representation?)
- **Implementation** (the code with the line numbers, the students have to explain the code by the line numbers)
- **Results** (the students should show the results of the program, how it can be used? until it produce the solution)
- **Conclusion**
