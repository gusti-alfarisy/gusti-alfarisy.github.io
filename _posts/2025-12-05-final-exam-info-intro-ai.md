The students should finish all the questions within 30 minutes. The topic includes agent and its environment, local search (hill climbing, SA), global search (Genetic Algorithm), Adversarial Search, Logical programming, Probabilistic reasoning (Bayesian Network), Machine Learning (Decision tree, logistic regression, clustering), Artificial Neural Networks, Basic CV and NLP, and Ethic and Bias in AI.

The students who cannot attend the exam in the class will get zero score which account for 15% of total score in this course.

Having the conventional exam, the second stage is presenting the solution of the proposed problem through AI methods. This will results in 50% of total score for this course. Each group only have 10 minutes to explain the solution/demo. Prior attenting the presentation session, the student must submit the markdown as a final report. The minimal suggested format:

```markdown
# Title

## Implementation
