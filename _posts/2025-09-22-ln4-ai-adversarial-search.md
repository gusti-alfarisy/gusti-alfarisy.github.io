When two or more agents pursue conflicting goals, a problem known as adversarial search arises. In this lecture, we will explore how agents operate in competitive environments, where each agent must reason about and respond to the actions of others to achieve its objective.

## Two-player zero-sum games

zero-sum games means that there is unlikely to have multiple winners which means that what is good for one entitiy is bad for the others. 

For agent in games the synonym for action and state are move and position respectively.

* $$S_0$$ is the initial state, the starting condition of a game
* TO-MOVE(s): player whose turn it is to move in state s
* ACTIONS(s): the set of legal moves in state s
* RESULT(s, a) is a transition model that defines the state resulting from taking action a in state s
* IS-TERMINAL(s) is a terminal test which is true when the game is over and false otherwise
* UTILITY(s, p) is a utility function (can be considered as objective function). This provide numerical value to player p when in terminate state s (the game ends). In case of chess the outcomes are win (1), loss (0), or draw (0.5)

$$
\text{MINIMAX}(s) =
\begin{cases}
\text{UTILITY}(s, \text{MAX}), & \text{if IS-TERMINAL(s)} \\[6pt]
\max\limits_{a \in \text{ACTIONS}(s)} \text{MINIMAX}(\text{RESULT}(s,a)), & \text{if TO-MOVE}(s) = \text{MAX} \\[6pt]
\min\limits_{a \in \text{ACTIONS}(s)} \text{MINIMAX}(\text{RESULT}(s,a)), & \text{if TO-MOVE}(s) = \text{MIN}
\end{cases}
